Implementing time ranges when extracting tweets.
The line bellow is deleted from get_tweets_single_user.py because I think this challenge has to be solved 
elsewhere. The result of the request in get_tweets_single_user.py gives a piece of metadata, containing the 
newest and oldest tweet_id. Using these ids to extract find the created_at data of the newest and oldest tweet
gives the time range between these tweets.

[] - Be able the specify a time range for the tweets to recieve.
[] - Change the twitter API communication to a class.
[] - Build a base class containing the methodes for making the requests to the APIs and
        let the specific API classes inherrit from the base class.

Transforming the text of the tweets to unicode to keep the opportunity of trying to use emojis in a sentiment
analysis

!! In the notes it is specified to be stored in the database, initialy resoning it will make the queries easier
but this feels a bit to much like overkill, so it is decided that this needs to be fixed in the querying process
instead of storing reduntant infomation in the database.
