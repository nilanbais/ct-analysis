Implementing time ranges when extracting tweets.
The line bellow is deleted from get_tweets_single_user.py because I think this challenge has to be solved 
elsewhere. The result of the request in get_tweets_single_user.py gives a piece of metadata, containing the 
newest and oldest tweet_id. Using these ids to extract find the created_at data of the newest and oldest tweet
gives the time range between these tweets.

[] - be able the specify a time range for the tweets to recieve.
